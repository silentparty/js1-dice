# Rolling Dice

For this exercise, you'll be creating a page that displays a random update of
two dice every time the user hits the "Roll Dice" button.

## Instructions

Start by creating a new repository on GitHub, then clone it to your machine
(follow GitHub's instructions).

Extract the contents of the homework `.zip` archive (including this file) into
your newly cloned repository.

Use git to `add`, `commit`, and `push` the files to GitHub (use `status` to make
sure you've added and committed everything).

Edit the `js/app.js` file to complete your solution.

Try out your solution by opening the `index.html` file in your favourite
browser.

Once you're done, `add`, `commit`, and `push` the `js/app.js` file again, then
send the GitHub URL for the repository to your instructors via Slack.

## Assessment

There is **no** formal assessment associated with this homework. It is intended
as a continuation of Lesson 03; Conditionals & Functions.

Your instructors will be looking for the following things when they review your
solution;

* Clarity of code
* Usage of Functions
* Completion of the problem

## Hints:

- Use `getElementByid` to find the dice elements in the HTML:
